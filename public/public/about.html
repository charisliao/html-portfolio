<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a first year Molecular Science and Software Engineering (MSSE) Master student at UC Berkeley. 
  I aspired to be a change-maker who is passionate in technology & health and hope to make a positive 
  impact on people's day-to-day life through tech. With degrees in Data Science and Molecular and Cell Biology,
  I hope to deepen my knowledge and skillsets between the intersection of science and engineering
  through my master program. </p>

</p>My primary software languages are python and java. 
However, I also have some data analytics experience using R and SQL. 
Throughout my undergraduate career at Cal, I was lucky to have the opportunity 
to join the Data Discovery Program and co-lead a team to perform a comprehensive data
oriented project for a Canadian pharmaceutical startup. 
I'm very thankful to have this opportunity as this exposed me to using platforms such
as AWS cloud services (EC2, RDS, Sagemaker, Athena, etc), Microsoft remote desktop,
Databricks, etc. With this experience, I look forward to future opportunities and learning 
in tech.</p>
  
<p>During my senior year of undergrad, I was recruited to assist the Berkeley-Taiwan Health
  Innovation Accelerator Program (A collaboration accelerator between SkyDeck and UC Berkeley
  School of Public Health. It supports an annual cohort of startups from Taiwan who are seeking
  to bring their health innovations to the U.S. market) where I helped manage workshops, 
  networking events, follow-ups, and logistics. Working for the program, I'm beyond grateful to 
  have met many amazing and talented entrepreneurs, and to discovered that I'm also interested in 
  project management. 
  <br />
  All seriousness aside, besides work and school, I really enjoy my time being outdoor. 
  I love exploring new restaurants (yes, I'm a foodie), new hiking trails, new beaches, 
  and learning new skills.</p>

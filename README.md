# html-portfolio

Welcome to Charis's html portfolio. Since I've just started to learn about html, I decided to create a small pure html portfolio to contain my HTML projects.
Note: There's no CSS and javascript involved in here. This is just a place for me to showcase some simple projects that I've created using pure HTML.

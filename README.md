# html-portfolio

Welcome to Charis's html portfolio. Since I've just started to learn about HTML, I've decided to create a small pure HTML portfolio to showcase the skill I learned.
Note: There's no CSS nor javascript involved in here. This is just a place for me to showcase some simple projects that I've created using pure HTML.
